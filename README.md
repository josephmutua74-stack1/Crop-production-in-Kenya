### Crop production data analysis for counties in Kenya.
Agriculture remains a cornerstone of Kenya’s economy, contributing significantly to food security, employment, and national GDP.
Across counties such as Nakuru County, Uasin Gishu County, Machakos County, and Machakos County crop production varies based on climatic conditions,
irrigation practices, crop varieties, and investment levels.

This project presents a comprehensive data analysis of crop production across selected counties in Kenya. 
The analysis focuses on understanding the relationship between:

1. Crop type

2. Crop variety

3. Cost of production

4. Yield per acre(kgs)

5. Irrigation type

6. Profit margins
   
### Project goal
The goal is to uncover patterns, compare county performance, evaluate cost-efficiency and identify high-profit crop varieties under different irrigation systems

### Project objectives
. Analyze crop production trends across counties

. Compare profitability across crop types and varieties

. Evaluate the impact of irrigation methods (rain-fed, drip, sprinkler, flood irrigation)

. Assess cost of production vs. yield performance

. Identify high-performing counties and crop combinations

. Provide data-driven insights for farmers, policymakers, and agribusiness investors

**1. Crop variety performance**
   -Across all counties and all seasons, local crop varieties were the highest yielding per acre(kg) -393.50k
   - A cross all counties the hybrid crop varieties had the lowest cost of production.
   - However the local varieties were slightly more profitable. this could have greatly contributed by;
   -   1. Market preference
       2. Lower input dependency- ability to re-use
       3. climate resilience by local varieties hence slight higher yield
    
**2. Irrigation type impacts**

The common irrigation methods used across the counties were, Drip,Flood and Sprinkler methods.
- Across the counties, Drip and flood irrigation methods had the highest yielding.
- Drip irrigation was very expensive across counties, sprinkler irrigation beibg the most cost effective
- Flood irrigation was the most profitable across the counties especially for local crop varieties.

**3. County level analysis**

In general, Nairobi county was the highest yielding county with a production of 140.57k.

From the analysis Nairobi county relied of flood irrigation and mainly on local crop varieties hence the high production.

Nakuru county had the highest cost of production across the counties. The county relied on Drip irrigation for its farming hence the high cost of production.

-This could have been majorly contribuited to by the high cost of installation and maintenance of drips.

-Nyeri and Nairobi counties were the most profitable areas with profit margins of 13.07M and 10.51M respectively. Partly because of their low cost of production.

**Overall, the results demonstrate that:**__

1. Lower production costs do not automatically translate into higher profitability.

2. Locally adapted crop varieties can generate stronger financial returns under prevailing market and climatic conditions

The analysis also identified flood irrigation as the most cost-effective irrigation method in the assessed counties.
While advanced irrigation technologies such as drip and sprinkler systems are often promoted for efficiency, their higher capital and maintenance costs may limit financial viability for smallholder farmers. 
In contrast, flood irrigation, where water access permits, delivered competitive yields relative to investment, resulting in stronger cost–benefit performance.
